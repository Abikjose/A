# GitHub Action Workflow for Creating GitHub Releases

This GitHub Action workflow automates the process of creating GitHub Releases for repositories A and B. Whenever a new Semantic Versioning (SemVer) tag is added to either repository A or B, this workflow will be triggered, ensuring that a GitHub Release is generated for repository A.

## Workflow Strategy

The workflow follows the following strategy to create GitHub Releases:

1. **Event Trigger**: The workflow is triggered by a `push` event whenever a new tag is added to either repository A or B. The `tags` filter ensures that only tag-related events trigger the workflow.

2. **Checkout Repositories**: The workflow starts by checking out both repository A and B. This allows access to their respective codebases during the workflow execution.

3. **Test Execution**: If necessary, you can add steps to run unit tests, integration tests, or any other validations required for repository A and B. These steps ensure the code quality and functionality of the software product.

4. **Release Creation**: After the necessary tests and validations, the workflow proceeds to create a GitHub Release for repository A using the `actions/create-release` action. The release is created with the same SemVer tag name and release name, making it easy to track and manage versions of repository A.

5. **Release Properties**: The created release is marked as a final release (not a draft or pre-release), making it publicly available to users. Additional details and assets, such as release notes or binary files, can be added to the release if desired.

## Usage

To use this workflow in your own repository, follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the workflow file provided in this repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/release.yml`).

2. Navigate to your repository on GitHub and go to the "Actions" tab.

3. Click on the "New workflow" button or select an existing workflow file if you already have one.

4. Name your workflow file (e.g., `release.yml`), and paste the copied contents into the editor.

5. Save the workflow file, and GitHub Actions will automatically start running the workflow whenever a new SemVer tag is pushed to either repository A or B.

Please ensure that you customize the workflow file by replacing `<username>/<repository-A>` and `<username>/<repository-B>` with the appropriate paths to your GitHub repositories.

## Conclusion

By utilizing this GitHub Action workflow, you can streamline the process of creating GitHub Releases for repositories A and B. It ensures that whenever a new SemVer tag is added to either repository, a corresponding release is automatically generated for repository A. This automation simplifies version management and allows for efficient distribution and communication with users.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to the repository maintainers.

Happy releasing!
